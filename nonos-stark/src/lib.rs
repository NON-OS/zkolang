//! Transparent, post-quantum STARK verification primitives. Hash-based and
//! curve-free, so verification relies only on the strength of the hash. Built
//! bottom up: the Goldilocks field, a Merkle commitment over it, polynomials,
//! a Fiat-Shamir transcript, and the FRI low-degree test on top.
//!
//! Shared between the kernel (which proves and verifies) and the bootloader
//! (which verifies the kernel self-attestation before jumping). Both link the
//! same code, so the Fiat-Shamir keccak and the measurement blake3 are
//! byte-identical on the prover and the verifier.
