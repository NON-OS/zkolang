//! Verify several Poseidon Merkle openings in one STARK, the heavy half of a FRI
//! query verifier: a query opens two values per layer, all under different
//! roots, and this proves the whole batch at once. Each opening occupies a fixed
//! run of rows and is a Merkle path verification; at an opening boundary the
//! state resets to the next opening's public leaf and first sibling. The leaves
//! are public (a FRI proof reveals its openings), and every root is pinned at
