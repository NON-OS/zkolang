//! Recovering an index as a field element from the bits that already carry it.
//! A Merkle opening proves a position through its path directions, and anything
//! that hashes the same position as a scalar (a nullifier over a leaf index, say)
//! is otherwise free to hash a different one, so the two must be tied. This runs
//! `acc = sum_k bit_k * 2^k`, one row per bit: the bits ride the trace, where the
//! assembly binds them to the opening directions that already carry the position,
//! the powers of two are periodic, and the accumulator starts at a boundary of
//! zero. The final accumulator is witness, bound to wherever the scalar is
//! consumed. Same shape as `IndexPoint`, with a sum where that has a product.
