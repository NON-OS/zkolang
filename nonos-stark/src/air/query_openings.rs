//! Extracting a Poseidon-committed proof's query-`k` authentication openings: the
//! DEEP value against the FRI root, the composition against the composition root,
//! and every trace column against its trace root, all at the k-th consistency query
//! position. These are exactly the openings the inner verifier authenticates before
//! it trusts the DEEP algebra (`verify_poseidon_ext` runs the same three checks). A
//! recursive verifier authenticates them with one batched membership region, closing
//! the gap where the opened values feeding the DEEP check were trusted rather than
//! proven to be the committed ones. The batch is equal depth because the trace, the
//! composition, and the DEEP polynomial are all committed over the same domain.
