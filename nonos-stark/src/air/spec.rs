//! The algebraic intermediate representation a STARK proves. A computation is a
//! trace of `trace_width` columns; the transition reads a sliding window of
//! consecutive rows and returns the constraint values that must vanish on every
//! trace row but the last `window_size - 1`, and boundary constraints pin a
//! chosen `(column, row)` to a public value. A single column proves a chain; a
//! wider trace proves a permutation over a multi-element state, which is what a
//! hash round is. Any type implementing this is proven by the same engine.
