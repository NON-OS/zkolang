# The language

zKølang source is a sequence of statements over field values. There are four
statement forms and a handful of expression forms, and every one lowers to a
fixed set of machine instructions. This page shows each construct next to the
opcode it produces. The lexer, parser, and compiler are in
`userland/nonos_zkolang/src/lang/`.

## Grammar

The tokens the lexer recognises are exactly `let`, `assert`, `input`, `secret`,
`for`, `in`, `if`, `else`, `fn`, `const`, `output`, `inv`, `sel`, the operators
`+ - * / == !=` and unary `-`, the punctuation `( ) , ; { } [ ] ..`, identifiers,
and decimal numbers (`src/lang/lex/`). Line comments run from `//` to the end of
the line. The grammar, lowest precedence first, is:

```
program  := item*
item     := constdef | fndef | stmt
constdef := 'const' ident '=' '[' number (',' number)* ']' ';'
fndef    := 'fn' ident '(' params? ')' '=' expr ';'
params   := ident (',' ident)*
stmt     := 'let' ident '=' expr ';'
          | 'assert' expr ';'
          | 'input' ident ';'
          | 'secret' ident ';'
          | 'output' expr ';'
          | 'for' ident 'in' number '..' number '{' stmt* '}'
expr     := equality
equality := sum (('==' | '!=') sum)?
sum      := product (('+' | '-') product)*
product  := unary (('*' | '/') unary)*
unary    := '-' unary | primary
primary  := atom ('[' expr ']')*
atom     := number | ident | ident '(' args? ')' | '(' expr ')'
          | 'inv' '(' expr ')'
          | 'sel' '(' expr ',' expr ',' expr ')'
          | 'if' expr '{' expr '}' 'else' '{' expr '}'
args     := expr (',' expr)*
```

## Statements

A `let` binds a name to the value of an expression. Values are single-assignment
at the source level, and a name resolves to the most recent `let` that bound it,
which gives ordinary lexical shadowing. The compiler reuses physical registers for
dead temporaries, so register pressure follows the depth of an expression rather
than its size and larger programs fit the sixteen-register file
(`src/lang/compile/`).

```
let a = 3;        // Imm  r0 = 3
let s = a + b;    // Add  r_s = r_a + r_b
```

An `assert` states that an expression is zero. It compiles to the zero-assertion
opcode, so `assert e` reads as "e must be zero". A comparison reads naturally too:
`assert a == b` proves equality, and `assert a != b` proves inequality (by
inverting the difference, which fails only when it is zero).

```
assert p - 64;    // p == 64, the direct zero form
assert p == 64;   // the same, read as an equality
assert a != b;    // a and b must differ
```

An `input` binds a name to the next public input. Inputs are supplied to the
prover in declaration order, and their values are bound into the proof.

```
input x;          // Inp  r_x = public_input[0]
```

A `secret` binds a name to the next private input, a witness the prover supplies
that never enters the public statement. It lets a program prove knowledge of a
hidden value that satisfies a public relation, for example a square root:

```
secret w;         // Inp  r_w = a private witness
assert w * w - 25;  // proves knowledge of a root of 25 without revealing w
```

This is a private witness, not full zero-knowledge: the STARK is not hiding, so
the openings could still leak trace values. What `secret` guarantees is that the
value is not part of the committed public statement.

An `output` exposes an expression as the next public output. Outputs are the
values a verifier reads off the proof.

```
output y;         // Out  public_output[0] = r_y
```

A `for` loop repeats its body over a compile-time range, and the compiler unrolls
it into straight-line code. The loop variable is a constant in the body, so the
program's shape stays static. A loop is exactly its hand-unrolled body; it is the
way to write repeated work like an accumulator or a power without repeating lines.

```
let acc = 0;
for i in 0 .. 4 { let acc = acc + i; }   // acc = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
output acc;
```

## Expressions

Arithmetic is field add, subtract, and multiply. Multiply binds tighter than add
and subtract; parentheses group.

```
let p = (a + b) * (a - b);   // two Adds/Subs then a Mul
```

`inv(e)` is the field inverse. The inverse of zero has no value, so a program that
inverts zero produces no valid trace and is reported as unprovable rather than
returning a wrong answer.

```
let q = inv(x);   // Inv  r_q = r_x^{-1}
```

`a == b` yields a clean bit: one when the two are equal, zero otherwise. It is an
equality test, not an assignment.

```
let e = a == b;   // Eq  r_e = (r_a == r_b) as {0,1}
```

`sel(c, a, b)` is a branchless conditional: it returns `a` when `c` is one and `b`
when `c` is zero, and `c` must be a bit. Both arms are always evaluated, which is
what keeps the trace shape independent of the data.

```
let m = sel(e, a, b);   // Sel  r_m = e ? a : b
```

`if c { a } else { b }` is the same select in a more familiar shape. Both arms are
single expressions, because the lowering to `sel` evaluates both and chooses one.

```
let m = if e { a } else { b };   // exactly sel(e, a, b)
```

## Functions

A `fn` names a reusable expression. Its body is a single expression over its
parameters, and each call is that body with the arguments substituted in place, so
a function is a hygienic macro with call syntax rather than a runtime call. There
is no call stack, no return keyword, and no recursion: the compiler inlines every
call, so a program stays straight-line and proves exactly as if the body had been
written out by hand.

```
fn sq(x) = x * x;
fn madd(a, b, c) = a * b + c;

input p;
let r = madd(sq(p), 2, 1);   // p*p*2 + 1, inlined with no call overhead
output r;
```

The body sees only its own parameters and the other functions, never the caller's
names, so a parameter named `x` never captures a `let x` at the call site. Three
things are compile errors: a call to a name no `fn` defines, a call whose argument
count differs from the definition, and a call that would recur (which, because
inlining a recursive call cannot terminate, is caught as too-deep inlining). A
function costs nothing at proof time that its inlined body would not: it is a way
to write a relation once and reuse it, not a new machine feature.

## Constant tables

A `const` names a fixed list of field values. A read `T[i]` selects one entry, and
the index must fold to a compile-time constant: a literal, a loop variable, or the
arithmetic that combines them. Because both the table and the index are static, a
read resolves to a single value while the program is lowered, so a table costs one
immediate per read and nothing more; the table itself never reaches the trace.

```
const RC = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for r in 0 .. 2 {
    output RC[r * 3 + 2];   // width-3 layout, row r, column 2
}
```

This is the data shape a hash needs. A round schedule addresses its constants as
`RC[round * width + lane]`, and a mixing matrix is another table read by the same
static arithmetic, so the constants are written once instead of as hundreds of
literals. The index is deliberately static: an index that depended on a witness
would make the program's shape data-dependent, which the straight-line model does
not allow, so a runtime index is a compile error rather than a silent read.

## A complete program

The canonical example, from `src/lang/mod.rs`, computed and proven end to end:

```
let a = 3;
let b = 5;
let s = a + b;      // 8
let p = s * s;      // 64
let q = inv(b);     // 5^{-1}
let eqv = s == 8;   // 1
let pick = sel(eqv, a, b);  // a, because eqv is 1
assert p - 64;      // p == 64
```

A program that reads a public input, computes, and exposes a public output:

```
input x;
let y = x * x * x;
output y;           // proves y = x^3 for the committed public x and y
```

Running this on `x = 3` proves the statement and returns `y = 27`. See
[from program to proof](04-program-to-proof.md) for how to run it.

## What the surface does not have, on purpose

There are no statement-level `if` blocks and no runtime function calls. A
conditional is the `if` expression, which is the branchless `sel`: both arms are
evaluated and one is chosen, so it introduces no data-dependent control flow. A
bounded `for` loop is unrolled at compile time over a literal range, and a `fn` is
inlined at each call, so neither adds control flow the trace could branch on. That
branchless, static shape is a deliberate limit: it is what makes a program's step
count a static property and the proof's cost knowable before you run it.
