//! The transition constraints, written once over any field so the base-field
//! composition and the extension-field out-of-domain evaluation share one
//! definition. Each returned value must be zero on every trace row. The groups are
//! selector well-formedness, the clock step, the opcode gates, and the register
//! binding (reads as a linear combination of the register file, writes as a
//! carry-or-update per register).
