//! Lowering: the AST to a flat VM program. The language is single-assignment at
//! the source level, but the compiler reuses physical registers: once a temporary
//! subexpression value has been consumed by its parent, its register returns to a
//! free pool for the next temporary. This keeps register pressure at the depth of
//! the expression rather than its size, so a real program like a range proof fits
//! the sixteen-register file. Register indices stay compile-time constants, which
//! is all the step AIR's register binding needs, so reuse is invisible to it.
//!
//! The lowering is split by concern: the compiler state and register allocator,
//! the statement lowering, and the expression lowering (arithmetic, the witnessed
//! gadgets, the conditional, and inlined function calls).
