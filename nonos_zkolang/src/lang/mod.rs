//! The zkolang source language front-end.
//!
//! A small, total, straight-line language that compiles to the VM instruction
//! set the step AIR proves. A program is a sequence of `let` bindings and
//! `assert` statements over field values:
//!
//! ```text
//!   let a = 3;
//!   let b = 5;
//!   let s = a + b;      // add
//!   let p = s * s;      // multiply
//!   let q = inv(b);     // field inverse
//!   let eqv = s == 8;   // equality yields a 0/1 bit
//!   let pick = sel(eqv, a, b);  // branchless conditional
//!   assert p - 64;      // assert an expression is zero
//! ```
//!
//! The grammar, lowest precedence first:
//!
//! ```text
//!   program := stmt*
//!   stmt    := 'let' ident '=' expr ';' | 'assert' expr ';'
//!   expr    := equality
//!   equality:= sum ('==' sum)?
//!   sum     := product (('+' | '-') product)*
//!   product := primary ('*' primary)*
//!   primary := number | ident | '(' expr ')'
//!            | 'inv' '(' expr ')'
//!            | 'sel' '(' expr ',' expr ',' expr ')'
//! ```
//!
//! Every value is single-assignment: each subexpression takes a fresh register,
//! which is why the compiled trace binds cleanly to the register file. There are
//! no loops or jumps in the surface language yet; a bounded `for` is unrolled by
//! the front-end before it reaches the compiler, so a program's step count is
//! always a static property. `assert e` compiles to the zero-assertion opcode, so
//! it reads as "e must be zero"; write `assert x - y` to require `x == y`.
