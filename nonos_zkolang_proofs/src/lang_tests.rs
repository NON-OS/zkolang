//! End-to-end proofs of the zkolang source language. A program written as text is
//! compiled, run, proven, and verified through the one-call driver. A true
//! program verifies; a false claim has no trace to prove; a malformed program is
//! a typed compile error. These run on the host under `cargo test`.
